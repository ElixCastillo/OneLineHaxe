##### New Scripts / Fixes

I'd love to collect different scripts here for different OS's and different Haxe versions.  Feel free to fork the repo, add a new script (or fix one) and update the README to include the code to launch your script.

##### Extra Info

If you have any extra info, eg ("this also works with Ubuntu 13.04") send a pull request with an update to the README.

##### Issues

If you have any issues, requests, or pull requests just aren't your thing, feel free to file a [New Issue](https://github.com/jasononeil/OneLineHaxe/issues/new) and we'll try look at it.
